PushMobage - Android
===========================

This is an Android sample app showing you how to use remote notifications.

This directory is meant to be an Eclipse workspace that should be opened with an Eclipse Indigo that has been set up with the Android tools. You will need to open the workspace and add the `facebook` and `PushMobage` projects to it.

Before opening the project in Eclipse, you should copy the `credentials.xml.template` file in `res/values` to `credentials.xml` and fill in the values with your own credentials.
