PushMobage
===========================

This is an iOS sample app showing you how to use remote notifications.

To compile the app, you will need to copy `PushMobage/Credentials.h.template` to `PushMobage/Credentials.h` and fill in your app's values.

To run the app and receive notifications, you will need to change the bundle ID to your app's bundle ID before building and run it on a device that is properly provisioned to run that app.
